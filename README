This is radsecproxy version 1.0-alpha-p1, which is a generic RADIUS
proxy that can support various RADIUS clients over UDP or TLS
(RadSec).

It should build on most Linux and BSD platforms by simply typing
"make". You may also try to use autoconf, but this is currently
unsupported.

To use it you need to create a config file which normally is
called "/etc/radsecproxy.conf". If this is not found, the
proxy will look for radsecproxy.conf in the current directory.
You can also specify the location with the "-c" command line
option (see below). For further instructions, please see the
enclosed example file and the documentation at
http://software.uninett.no/radsecproxy/?page=documentation

There are four options that may be specified on the command line.
"-c configfile" to specify a non-default config file path;
"-d loglevel" to set a loglevel of 1, 2, 3 or 4 where 4 is the most
detailed; and "-f" to run the proxy in the foreground with logging
to stderr. Without "-f" the default is to detach as a daemon and
log to syslog. Finally "-v" just prints version information and
exits.

Thanks to Stefan Winter and Andreas Solberg for making me do this,
and the funding from GEANT2. Stefan as well as Kolbjørn Barmen
and Maja Wolniewicz have helped with early testing of the code.
All of the above plus Milan Sova have provided good feedback on
several implementation choices. Finally thanks to Hans Zandbelt
for providing the autoconf stuff. I may have forgotten someone,
let me know if you feel left out.
