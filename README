This is a beta version of a generic RADIUS proxy that can support
various RADIUS clients over UDP or TLS (RadSec).

It should build on most Linux and BSD platforms by simply typing
"make". You may also try to use autoconf if you like.

To use it you need to create a config file called
"radsecproxy.conf" which must be in /etc/radsecproxy (unless
you alter it in the header file), the current directory, or
you can specify the location with the "-c" command line
option (see below). See the enclosed example file for further
instructions.

There are three options that may be specified on the command line.
"-c configfile" to specify a non-default config file path;
"-d loglevel" to set a loglevel of 1, 2, 3 or 4 where 4 is the most
detailed; and "-f" to run the proxy in the foreground with logging
to stderr. Without "-f" the default is to detach as a daemon and
log to syslog.

Thanks to Stefan Winter and Andreas Solberg for making me do this,
and the funding from GEANT2. Stefan as well as Kolbjørn Barmen
and Maja Wolniewicz have helped with early testing of the code.
All of the above plus Milan Sova have provided good feedback on
several implementation choices. Finally thanks to Hans Zandbelt
for providing the autoconf stuff. I may have forgotten someone,
let me know if you feel left out.
