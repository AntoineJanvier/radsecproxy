This is the very first experimental version of a generic RADIUS proxy
that can support various RADIUS clients over UDP or TLS (RadSec).

It should build on most Linux platforms by simply typing "make".
To use it you need to create three config files. These are the
main config file "radsecproxy.conf" and server and client files
"servers.conf" and "clients.conf". See the enclosed example files
for further instructions.

The config files must be in either "/etc/radsecproxy" or the
proxy's current work directory. You may alter the path near
the top of radsecproxy.h if necessary.

For more information, feedback etc. contact <venaas@uninett.no>.
