This is radsecproxy 1.7.1.

radsecproxy is a generic RADIUS proxy that supports both UDP and TLS
(RadSec) RADIUS transports.  There is also experimental support for
TCP and DTLS.

It should build on most Unix like systems by simply typing

    ./configure && make

It is possible to specify which RADIUS transport the build should
support.  Without any special options to configure, all transports
supported by the system will be enabled.  See the output from
"./configure --help" for how to change this.

To use radsecproxy you need to create a config file which is normally
found in /usr/local/etc/radsecproxy.conf.  You can also specify the
location with the "-c" command line option (see below).  For further
instructions, please see the enclosed example file and the manpages
radsecproxy(1) and radsecproxy.conf(5)

The following options may be specified on the command line:
"-c configfile" to specify a non-default config file path.
"-d loglevel" to set a loglevel of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 where 5 is the
              most detailed.
"-f" to run the proxy in the foreground with logging to stderr.
     Without "-f" the default is to detach as a daemon and log to
     syslog.
"-i pidfile" to name a file to which the PID is written.
"-v" just prints version information and exits.
"-p" (pretend) makes the proxy go through the configuration files as
     normal, but stops before creating any sockets or doing any
     serious work.  This is useful for validating config files.
