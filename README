This is a beta version of a generic RADIUS proxy that can support
various RADIUS clients over UDP or TLS (RadSec).

It should build on most Linux and BSD platforms by simply typing
"make". To use it you need to create three config files. These
are the main config file "radsecproxy.conf" and server and client
files "servers.conf" and "clients.conf". See the enclosed example
files for further instructions.

The config files must be in either "/etc/radsecproxy" or the
proxy's current work directory. You may alter the path near
the top of radsecproxy.h if necessary.

There are two options that may be specified on the command line.
They are "-d loglevel" to set a loglevel of 1, 2 or 3 where 3
is the most detailed logging. Also "-f" to run the proxy in
the foreground with logging to stderr. Without "-f" the default
is to detach as a daemon and log to syslog.
