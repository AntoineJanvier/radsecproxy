This is a beta version of a generic RADIUS proxy that can support
various RADIUS clients over UDP or TLS (RadSec).

It should build on most Linux and BSD platforms by simply typing
"make". To use it you need to create a config file called
"radsecproxy.conf" which must be in /etc/radsecproxy (unless
you alter it in the header file), the current directory, or
you can specify the location with the "-c" command line
option (see below). See the enclosed example file for further
instructions.

There are three options that may be specified on the command line.
"-c configfile" to specify a non-default config file path;
"-d loglevel" to set a loglevel of 1, 2, 3 or 4 where 4 is the most
detailed; and "-f" to run the proxy in the foreground with logging
to stderr. Without "-f" the default is to detach as a daemon and
log to syslog.

For more information, feedback etc. contact <venaas@uninett.no>.
