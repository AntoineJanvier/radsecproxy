libradsec is a non-working RADIUS library doing UDP, TCP, TLS and
DTLS.

libradsec depends on 
- libradius from the FreeRADIUS freeradius-server
- libevent2
- libconfuse
- openssl (if configured with tls or dtls support)


To compile the library and the examples, do something like

 sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make

If any of the libraries are not found, try setting environment
variable LDFLAGS at configure time

 LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/freeradius -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure


The parts of the library which has been tested has been so on Linux
(Ubuntu 10.04) with libfreeradius2 (2.1.8+dfsg-1ubuntu1), libconfuse0
(2.6-2) and libevent-2.0.7-rc-dev (http://monkey.org/~provos/).

The file HACKING contains more detailed info on the state of the
various parts of the library.
