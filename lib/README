libradsec depends on 
- libconfuse
- libevent2
- openssl (if configured with --enable-tls)


For changes between releases, see the CHANGES file.


To compile the library and the examples, do something like

 sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make

If any of the libraries are not found, try setting environment
variable LDFLAGS at configure time like so:

  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --enable-tls


The parts of the library which has been tested has been so on Linux
(Debian) with libconfuse (2.7), libevent (2.0.19) and OpenSSL
(1.0.1c).

The file HACKING contains more detailed info on the state of the
various parts of the library.
