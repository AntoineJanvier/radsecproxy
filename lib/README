This is a non-working RADIUS library doing UDP, TCP, TLS and DTLS.

It depends on libradius from FreeRADIUS freeradius-server and
libevent2.

Those parts of the library which has been tested has been so on Linux
(Ubuntu 10.04) with libfreeradius2 (2.1.8+dfsg-1ubuntu1) and
libevent-2.0.7-rc-dev (http://monkey.org/~provos/).

The file HACKING contains more detailed info on the state of the
various parts of the library.
