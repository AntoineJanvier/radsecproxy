libradsec-0.0.1-dev is a non-working RADIUS library doing UDP, TCP,
TLS and DTLS.

Canonical pickup point:
http://git.nordu.net/?p=radsecproxy.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/libradsec

libradsec depends on 
- libradius from the FreeRADIUS freeradius-server
- libevent2
- libconfuse
- openssl (if configured with --enable-tls)


To compile the library and the examples, do something like

 sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make

If any of the libraries are not found, try setting environment
variable LDFLAGS at configure time like so:

 LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/freeradius -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure


The parts of the library which has been tested has been so on Linux
(Ubuntu 10.10) with libfreeradius2 (2.1.9+dfsg-1ubuntu1), libconfuse0
(2.7-1) and libevent-2.0.10-stable (http://monkey.org/~provos/).

The file HACKING contains more detailed info on the state of the
various parts of the library.
