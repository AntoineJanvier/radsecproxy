To compile the library and the examples, do something like

 sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make

If any of the libraries are not found, try setting environment
variable LDFLAGS at configure time like so:

  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --enable-tls


The parts of the library which has been tested has been so on Linux
