libradsec is a RADIUS library for clients doing RADIUS over UDP or
TLS.  The goal is to add support for writing servers (and thus
proxies) and to add transports TCP and DTLS.


The canonical pickup point is

The source code is licensed under two different licenses, a 3-clause
BSD license and the GNU General Public License (version 2 or later).
Users of this library may choose which of these suits them best.


libradsec depends on 
- libevent2
- libconfuse
- openssl (if configured with --enable-tls)


To compile the library and the examples, do something like

 sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make

If any of the libraries are not found, try setting environment
variable LDFLAGS at configure time like so:

 LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --enable-tls


The parts of the library which has been tested has been so on Linux
(Ubuntu 10.10) with libfreeradius2 (2.1.9+dfsg-1ubuntu1), libconfuse0
(2.7-1) and libevent-2.0.10-stable (http://monkey.org/~provos/).

The file HACKING contains more detailed info on the state of the
various parts of the library.
