HACKING file for libradsec (in Emacs -*- org -*- mode).

Status as of libradsec-0.0.1-dev (2011-03-12).

* Build instructions
cd libradsec/lib
sh autogen.sh
./configure #--enable-tls
make

examples/client -r examples/client-tls.conf blocking-tls; echo $?

* Design of the API
- There are three usage modes
  - You use the send and receive calls (blocking mode)
  - You register callbacks and run the libevent dispatch loop (user
    dispatch mode)
  - You run your own event loop, using fd's for select and do the I/O
    using the libradsec send/receive calls (on-your-own mode)
- Fully reentrant (FIXME: any issues with libfreeradius-radius?)

* Dependencies
This is on Ubuntu 10.10.

- libfreeradius-radius (2.1.9+dfsg-1ubuntu1)
  sudo apt-get install libfreeradius-dev libfreeradius2
- libconfuse (2.7-1)
  sudo apt-get install libconfuse-dev libconfuse0
- libevent from source (release-2.0.10-stable)
  git clone --branch release-2.0.10-stable git://levent.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/levent/levent
  cd levent; sh autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-openssl
  make && sudo make install
  
* Functionality and quality
** Tested and verified
** Not well tested
- reading config file
- [TCP] short read
- [TCP] short write
- [TLS] basic tls support
** Known issues
- leaking memory
- error stack is only one entry deep
** Not implemented
- custom allocation scheme used in all places
- server failover
- [TLS] verification of CNAME
- [TLS] preshared key support
- [DTLS] support
