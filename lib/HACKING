HACKING file for libradsec (in Emacs -*- org -*- mode).
* Design of the libraray
- three usage models
  - using send and receive calls in blocking mode
  - running the libevent loop, getting callbacks
  - running own event loop, using fd's for select and doing the i/o
    using libradsec send/receive
* Functionality
** Not implemented
- autoconf/automake/libtool
- client: matching responses, resending packets
- custom allocation scheme used in all places
- callbacks invoked properly
- server fail over
- TLS
- TLS PSK
- DTLS
** Not tested
- reading config file
- short read
- short write
** Tested and verified
