Build
-----

In order to build and run the tests, you'll need to have libcgreen
installed (http://www.lastcraft.com/cgreen.php).


Run
---

NOTE: To run the tests you need 
- a RADIUS server running at localhost:1820 with shared secret
  "sikrit" configured (or whatever "test-udp-auth" in test.conf says)
- a user "molgan" with password "password" present in the RADIUS
  database
These requirements will disappear in a future release.

Run the tests by typing

  make check

The output should read something like

  Completed "main": 32 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
