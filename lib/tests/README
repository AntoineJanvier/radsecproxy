Build
-----

In order to build and run the tests, you'll need to have libcgreen
installed (http://www.lastcraft.com/cgreen.php).


Run
---

NOTE: To run the tests you currently need
- a RADIUS server running at localhost:1820 with the shared RADIUS
  secret "sikrit" configured (or whatever "test-udp-auth" in test.conf
  says)
- a user "molgan@PROJECT-MOONSHOT.ORG" with password "password"
  present in the RADIUS database
These requirements will be removed in a future libradsec release.


Run the tests by typing

  make check

The output should read something like

  Completed "main": 32 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.


When trying to debug the test programs under GDB you might run into
trouble with multiple threads being executed by the test framework.
If so, make sure to run a single test rather than the full test suite.
For example:

  libtool --mode execute gdb --args test-udp test_auth
