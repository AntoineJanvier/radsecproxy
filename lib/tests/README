Build
-----

In order to build the tests, you'll need libcgreen
(http://www.lastcraft.com/cgreen.php).


Run
---

NOTE: To run the tests you need 
- a RADIUS server running at localhost:1820 with shared sekret
  "sikrit" configured (or whatever "test-udp-auth" in test.conf says)
- a user "molgan" with password "password" present in the RADIUS
  database
This requirement will disappear in the future.

Run the tests by typing

  ./test-udp

The output should be something like

  Completed "main": 32 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
