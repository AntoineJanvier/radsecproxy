Unreleased 1.6.6-dev
	Bug fixes:
	- Have rewriteIn for servers use the correct config section. We
	used to apply rewriteIn using the rewrite block of the client
	rather than the server. Patch by Fabian Mauchle. Fixes
	RADSECPROXY-59.
	- Handle CHAP authentication properly when there is no
	CHAP-Challenge. Fixes RADSECPROXY-58.

2013-09-06 1.6.5
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix a crash bug introduced in 1.6.4. Fixes RADSECPROXY-53,
	bugfix on 1.6.4.

2013-09-05 1.6.4
	Bug fixes:
	- Keeping Proxy-State attributes in all replies to clients
	(RADSECPROXY-52). Reported by Stefan Winter.

2013-09-05 1.6.3
	Enhancements:
	- Threads are allocated with a 32 KB stack rather than what
	happens to be the default. Patch by Fabian Mauchle.
	- On systems with mallopt(3), freed memory is returned to the
	system more aggressively. Patch by Fabian Mauchle.

	Bug fixes:
	- radsecproxy-hash(1) no longer prints the hash four times.
	Reported by Simon Lundström and jocar.
	- Escaped slashes in regular expressions now works. Reported by
	Duarte Fonseca. (RADSECPROXY-51)
	- The duplication cache is purged properly. Patch by Fabian
	Mauchle.
	- Stop freeing a shared piece of memory manifesting itself as a
	crash when using dynamic discovery. Patch by Fabian Mauchle.
	- Closing and freeing TLS clients properly. Patch by Fabian
	Mauchle.
	- Timing out on TLS clients not closing the connection properly.
	Patch by Fabian Mauchle.

2012-10-25 1.6.2
	Bug fixes (security):
	- Fix the issue with verification of clients when using multiple
	'tls' config blocks (RADSECPROXY-43) for DTLS too. Fixes
	CVE-2012-4566 (CVE id corrected 2012-11-01, after the release of
	1.6.2). Reported by Raphael Geissert.

2012-09-14 1.6.1
	Bug fixes (security):
	- When verifying clients, don't consider config blocks with CA
	settings ('tls') which differ from the one used for verifying the
	certificate chain. Reported by Ralf Paffrath. (RADSECPROXY-43,
	CVE-2012-4523).

	Bug fixes:
	- Make naptr-eduroam.sh check NAPTR type case insensitively.
	  Fix from Adam Osuchowski.

2012-04-27 1.6
	Incompatible changes:
	- The default shared secret for TLS and DTLS connections change
	from "mysecret" to "radsec" as per draft-ietf-radext-radsec-12
	section 2.3 (4).  Please make sure to specify a secret in both
	client and server blocks to avoid unwanted surprises.
	(RADSECPROXY-19)
	- The default place to look for a configuration file has changed
	from /etc to /usr/local/etc.  Let radsecproxy know where your
	configuration file can be found by using the `-c' command line
	option.  Or configure radsecproxy with --sysconfdir=/etc to
	restore the old behaviour.  (RADSECPROXY-31)

	New features:
	- Improved F-Ticks logging options.  F-Ticks can now be sent to a
	separate syslog facility and the VISINST label can now be
	configured explicitly.  This was implemented by Maja
	Gorecka-Wolniewicz and Paweł Gołaszewski.  (RADSECPROXY-29)
	- New config option PidFile.  (RADSECPROXY-32)
	- Preliminary support for DynamicLookupCommand added.  It's for
	TLS servers only at this point.  Also, beware of risks for memory
	leaks.  In addition to this, for extra adventurous users, there's
	a new configure option --enable-experimental-dyndisc which enables
	even more new code for handling of dynamic discovery of TLS
	servers.
	- Address family (IPv4 or IPv6) can now be specified for clients
	and servers.  (RADSECPROXY-37)

	Bug fixes:
	- Stop the autoconfery from warning about defining variables
	conditionally and unconditionally.
	- Honour configure option --sysconfdir.  (RADSECPROXY-31)
	- Don't crash on failing DynamicLookupCommand scripts.  Fix made
	with help from Ralf Paffrath.  (RADSECPROXY-33)
	- When a DynamicLookupCommand script is failing, fall back to
	other server(s) in the realm.  The timeout depends on the kind of
	failure.
	- Other bugs.  (RADSECPROXY-26, -28, -34, -35, -39, -40)

2011-10-08 1.5
	New features:
	- Support for F-Ticks logging.
	- New binary radsecproxy-hash.
	- A DynamicLookupCommand script can now signal "server not found"
	by exiting with code 10.  The scripts in the tools directory now
	do this.

	Incompatible changes:
	- catgconf renamed to radsecproxy-conf.

	Bug fixes:
	- All compiler warnings removed.  Now compiling with -Werror.

2011-07-22 1.4.3
	Notes:
	- The default secret for TLS and DTLS will change in a future
	release.  Please make sure to specify a secret in both client and
	server blocks to avoid surprises.

	Bug fixes:
	- Debug printout issue.

2010-11-23 1.4.2
	Bug fixes:
	- Don't disable OpenSSL session caching for 0.9.8p and newer in
	  the 0.9.x track.
	- Detect OpenSSL version at runtime rather than at compile time.

2010-11-17 1.4.1
	Bug fixes:
	- OpenSSL session caching is disabled when built against OpenSSL
	  older than 1.0.0b to mitigate possible effects of
	  http://openssl.org/news/secadv_20101116.txt (RADSECPROXY-14).
	- Crash bug when reading improper config file fixed.

2010-06-12 1.4
	Incompatible changes:
	- Log level 4 used to be DBG_DBG but is now DBG_NOTICE.  In order
	to keep the same behaviour as in previous versions of radsecproxy,
	those who have LogLevel set to 4 need to change this to 5.  Log
	levels 1, 2 and 3 are unaffected.

	New features and various improvements:
	- LoopPrevention per server has been added.
	- AddVendorAttribute rewrite configuration has been added.
	- New log level, DBG_NOTICE, added.
	- Diagnostics improved for errors resulting from failing syscalls.
	- Removed all compiler warnings (compiling with -Wall).

	Bug fixes:
	- A UDP fragmentation issue.
	- Build on Solaris when compiling with gcc.
	- A bug in pwdencrypt() with passwords of a length greater than
	16 octets.

	  If addTTL option is used, the TTL attribute is added with the
	    specified value if the forwarded message does not have one.
        PolicyOID option can be used to require certain CA policies.

2008-10-07 1.2

	regular expressions in realms etc can now be more advanced, including
	  use of "or".
        cacheExpiry option in tls blocks for specifying expiry time for the
	  cache of CA certificates and CRLs. This is particularly useful for
	  regularly updating CRLs.
