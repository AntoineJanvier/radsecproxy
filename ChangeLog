	rewritein rewriteout rewrite
	regular expressions in realms etc can now be more advanced, including
	  use of "or".
        cacheExpiry option in tls blocks for specifying expiry time for the

2010-06-12 1.4
	Incompatible changes:
	- Log level 4 used to be DBG_DBG but is now DBG_NOTICE.  In order
	to keep the same behaviour as in previous versions of radsecproxy,
	those who have LogLevel set to 4 need to change this to 5.  Log
	levels 1, 2 and 3 are unaffected.

	New features and various improvements:
	- LoopPrevention per server has been added.
	- AddVendorAttribute rewrite configuration has been added.
	- New log level, DBG_NOTICE, added.
	- Diagnostics improved for errors resulting from failing syscalls.
	- Removed all compiler warnings (compiling with -Wall).

	Bug fixes:
	- A UDP fragmentation issue.
	- Build on Solaris when compiling with gcc.
	- A bug in pwdencrypt() with passwords of a length greater than
	16 octets.
2010-11-17 1.4.1
	Bug fixes:
	- OpenSSL session caching is disabled when built against OpenSSL
	  older than 1.0.0b to mitigate possible effects of
	  http://openssl.org/news/secadv_20101116.txt (RADSECPROXY-14).
	- Crash bug when reading improper config file fixed.
2010-11-23 1.4.2
	Bug fixes:
	- Don't disable OpenSSL session caching for 0.9.8p and newer in
	  the 0.9.x track.
	- Detect OpenSSL version at runtime rather than at compile time.
2011-07-21 1.4.3-rc0
	Notes:
	- The default secret for TLS and DTLS will change in a future
	  relase.  Plaese make sure to specify a secret in both client and
	  server blocks to avoid surprises.
	Bug fixes:
	- Debug printout issue.
